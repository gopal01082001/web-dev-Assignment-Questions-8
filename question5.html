<!-- Q.5 Difference between class & function based component
In the context of React, there are two main ways to define components: class-based components and function-based components. Here are the key differences between the two:
Syntax: Class-based components are defined using JavaScript classes, while function-based components are defined using JavaScript functions.
State Management: Class-based components have built-in state management. They can have a local state that can be modified using this.setState(). On the other hand, function-based components can utilize the state management capabilities provided by React Hooks, such as the useState hook, to manage state within the component.
Lifecycle Methods: Class-based components have access to a range of lifecycle methods, such as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount. These methods allow you to perform certain actions at different stages of the component's lifecycle. Function-based components, before React Hooks, did not have direct equivalents to these lifecycle methods. However, with the introduction of Hooks, the useEffect hook can be used to achieve similar functionality.
Code Simplicity: Function-based components are generally considered simpler and easier to understand compared to class-based components. They tend to have a more concise syntax and avoid the complexities associated with classes and inheritance. Function-based components promote functional programming concepts and have become the preferred way of writing components in React.
Performance: Function-based components, specifically those using React Hooks, are optimized for performance. Hooks allow React to optimize the rendering process and avoid unnecessary re-renders. Class-based components, on the other hand, may require more manual optimizations to achieve similar performance gains.
It's worth noting that, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, function-based components have become the recommended approach for writing React components. With the introduction of React Hooks, function-based components gained more capabilities and a simpler syntax, making them a popular choice among developers. However, class-based components are still supported in React and may be necessary in certain situations, particularly when working with legacy code or third-party libraries that rely on class components.
