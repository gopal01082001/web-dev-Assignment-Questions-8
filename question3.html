<!-- Q.3 Difference between Virtual Dom vs Real Dom
The main difference between the Virtual DOM and the Real DOM (Document Object Model) lies in their behavior and how they handle updates to the user interface.
Real DOM:
The Real DOM is the actual tree-like structure that represents the elements of a web page.
It is a browser's internal representation of the HTML document, and any updates or changes to the DOM trigger reflows and repaints, affecting the rendering and performance of the web page.
Manipulating the Real DOM directly can be computationally expensive and slow, especially when dealing with large and complex UI structures.
Each update to the Real DOM may involve traversing the entire DOM tree, making changes, and updating the browser's rendering, even if only a small part of the DOM has changed.
Virtual DOM:
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy or abstraction of the Real DOM.
It is a JavaScript object that represents the structure and state of the UI components in a virtualized form.
Updates made to the Virtual DOM do not immediately affect the actual browser's rendering.
Instead, the Virtual DOM allows libraries and frameworks like React to compare and calculate the minimal set of changes needed to update the Real DOM efficiently.
By batching and optimizing these changes, the Virtual DOM can significantly reduce the number of direct manipulations performed on the Real DOM, resulting in improved performance.
Once the necessary changes are determined, the Virtual DOM updates the Real DOM only in the specific places where modifications are required, minimizing the impact on the overall rendering process.
In summary, the Real DOM is the actual browser representation of the web page, and any updates to it trigger expensive rendering operations. The Virtual DOM, on the other hand, is a lightweight representation that allows for efficient updates and minimizes direct interactions with the Real DOM, leading to improved performance and better user experience.
